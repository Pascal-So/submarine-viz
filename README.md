#Submarine task visualization

## Usage
Start blender from the terminal:
```
blender shipplayer1.blend
```

Then adjust the variable `path_to_logfile` in `setup.py` and set the variables that determine the speed of the animation, `turn_phase_length` and `move_phase_length`, higher or lower, depending on preference.

The animation can be started by moving the cursor over the 3d view and pressing `p`, or by pressing `Start` in the section `Standalone Player` in the `properties` editor to start the animation in a new window.
